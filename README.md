**Tetris, built from the ground up**

You can download the latest build of the game from the Releases tab, or you can compile it yourself if you prefer. Everything else you need to know you can find in the game. Not that there's much to know, it's literally just Tetris. Have fun!

This is my take on Tetris. I built the engine it's running on from scratch with the explicit intent of using as little already existing code (eg. libraries) as possible, trying to do as much of the work by myself as possible (within reason). It uses the Windows API for the OS-specific stuff like opening an application window and basic binary file I/O, so at the time of writing this application may only run on Windows machines. The music, sound effects, graphics, and all other assets were also created by me. This was created over the course of 7 months of on and off work as part of a school assignment.
